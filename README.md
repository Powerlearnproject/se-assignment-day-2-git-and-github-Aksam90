## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
The fundamental concept of version control is keeping track and managing of your codes at any point in time. It helps through tracking and collaboration with different teams or individuals. 

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
The major difference are as follows: cost and licensing, used cases, visibility, security and access control.

git commit -m "Add new feature" and merging the branch 'git checkout main' 'git merge new-feature'

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
It helps to facilitate review, discussion and integration of code changes. All discussions are centralized within the pull request. It helps to make communication to be accessible.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
